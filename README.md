# pymutekiu

Python Besta RTOS userland emulator.

It is effectively a spiritual successor to [PrimeU](https://github.com/opcod3/PrimeU).

The goal is not to be the best emulator on anything, but provide a prototyping ground for efficiently researching emulator architectures and documenting Besta RTOS behaviors in code form, so we can create better emulators in the future that are actually accurate, performant and elegant (and possibly written in Rust or C++).
